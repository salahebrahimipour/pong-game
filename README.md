# pong-game
This is a simple pong game to be played by two
The game is based on Python

# Installation
There is no specific exe or dmg as it is not written to be sold!
You simply download it and run it via below instructions(on mac):
  - Navigate to the folder you placed the file in. For instance the game is located on my desktop:
    
  cd ~/Desktop
  cd / pong
  python3 pong.py
    
for windows you need to do the same just use -python pong.py
- However, there is some issues with the sound in windows which I had no time to fix it!

# Info
The game needs some improvements which will be done in next version

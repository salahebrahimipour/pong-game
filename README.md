# pong-game
This is a simple pong game to be played by two.
The game is written with Python

# Installation
There is no specific exe or dmg as it is not written to be sold!
You simply download it and run it via the below instructions(on Mac):
  - Navigate to the folder you placed the file in. For instance, the game is located on my desktop:
    
    cd ~/Desktop
    
    cd/pong
    
    python3 pong.py
    
For Windows you need to do the same just use -python pong.py
- However, there is some issues with the sound in Windows which I had no time to fix it!

# Info
The game needs some improvements which will be done in the next version
